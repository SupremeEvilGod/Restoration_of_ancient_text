Installation

    Clone the repository:

    bash

git clone <repository_url>

Navigate to the project directory:

bash

cd <project_directory>

Install the required dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Prepare your degraded Kannada text images.
    Run the restoration script:

    bash

    python restore_text.py --input <path_to_images> --output <output_directory>

    The restored texts will be saved in the specified output directory.

Methodology

    Data Collection: Handwritten text images are collected from online sources and 250 student samples.
    Image Processing: Contour techniques are used to detect and segment text into individual letters.
    Model Preparation:
        Tesseract: Various letter combinations are utilized.
        CNN: Words are broken down into separate letters for training.

Dataset

The project uses a combination of online handwritten PDFs and samples collected from students, ensuring a diverse representation of Kannada handwriting.
Results

The system achieves high accuracy in restoring Kannada characters, significantly improving access to degraded texts.
